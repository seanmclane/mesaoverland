## **Consulting & Technical Services**

At Mesa Overland, we love helping people build the rig they’ve been dreaming about — whether it’s a full-blown expedition truck or a simple, ultralight slide-in.

Our founder and lead builder, **Blayne**, offers consulting in:

* Mechanical & chassis selection
* Habitat design & engineering
* Custom sizing & feasibility
* Fabrication planning
* Flatbeds, subframes & mounting systems
* Interior layouts & space planning
* Electrical systems (Victron & Bluetti RV5)
* Window/door selection
* Materials & workflow strategy

Consulting is billed at our standard shop rate of **$125–$175/hr**, depending on the work required.

# **Fully Custom Builds**

If you want something that doesn’t exist yet — this is where we shine.

Whether it's:

* A uniquely sized **flatbed or slide-in habitat**
* A fully engineered **frame-mounted expedition cabin**
* A highly detailed **premium interior**
* A one-off layout based entirely on your lifestyle and equipment

—we can build it.

### **Custom Sizing & Advanced Engineering**

* Custom sizing Phase 1 fee: **$1,500**
* Full custom design after Phase 1 is hourly
* Most complete custom design packages average **~$7,500**
* All custom engineering, CAD, CNC prep, and fabrication planning is **$125–$175/hr**

These projects take more time, more engineering, and more communication — but the result is a truly one-of-one habitat.

# **Spec Composite Habitat Models**

Our core lineup of **pre-engineered Mesa Overland models** is ideal for most customers. These models offer faster build timelines, predictable engineering, and excellent value.

They can be built as:

* Slide-ins
* Flatbeds
* Chassis-mounted habitats

### **Phase 1 – Shell Only**

Includes:

* Composite structure
* Arctic Tern Wildlands door
* Internal reinforcement
* Engineering & fitment
* Optional window and penetration cutouts

**Shell pricing typically ranges:**

* **High $20Ks** → small slide-ins
* **$30Ks–$40Ks** → most mid-size builds
* **$50Ks+** → large or monster frames

This is your ultra-strong composite foundation.

# **Phase 2 – Interiors, Systems, Electrical & Customization**

### **Standard Modifications Package**

**$2,500 for 20 hours** of design & customization, covering:

* Plyboo stain colors
* Powdercoat colors for cabinetry
* Cushion fabrics & upholstery
* Minor layout and interior tweaks
* Hardware choices
* Small refinements

### **Interior Buildouts (Standard or Custom)**

We offer everything from minimal builds to full expedition interiors:

* Aluminum-framed cabinetry w/ Plyboo faces
* Beds, dinettes, bunks
* Galleys & storage systems
* Water systems
* Heating
* Lighting & fixtures
* Flooring
* MOLLE panels
* Accessory mounting

### **Electrical Systems (Victron & Bluetti RV5)**

We can integrate:

* Complete **Victron Energy** systems
* The **Bluetti RV5** all-in-one system
* Solar arrays
* 12V/120V distribution
* Shore power
* Monitoring & automation

Phase 2 is your playground — we can do as much or as little as you want.

# **Standard Model Buildouts – Coming Soon**

We’re in the process of releasing a lineup of **Standard Model Buildouts** — factory-style interior packages that offer extreme value, fast turnaround, and predictable pricing.

These Standard Models take our best layouts, components, and systems and package them into highly streamlined offerings.

### **Standard Model Pricing**

As a general rule of thumb:

**A Standard Buildout typically starts at around double the shell price.**

Examples:

* A **$28K** slide-in shell → Standard buildout starting around **$55K–$60K**
* A **$38K** mid-size shell → Standard buildout starting around **$75K–$80K**
* A **$50K+** large shell → Standard buildout starting around **$100K+**

These setups include cabinetry, electrical, basic water systems, lighting, beds, finishes, storage solutions, and smart layout choices optimized from years of builds.

Custom upgrades can still be layered on top as desired.

# **Windows, Doors & Exterior Options**

We install:

### **Outbound Windows & Doors (Premium)**

* Best performance
* Top-tier thermal efficiency
* Highest durability
* Clean aesthetic
* Strongly recommended

### **Tern Overland (Arctic Tern) Windows**

* Lightweight
* Budget-friendly
* Excellent performance
* Perfect for weight-sensitive or cost-conscious builds

Both integrate beautifully with our composite shells.

# **Subframes, Mounting Systems & Flatbeds**

### **Rail-on-Rail Low-Torsion Subframe (Chassis-Mount)**

Our preferred mounting approach for expedition-grade builds.\
Allows full chassis flex without stressing the composite structure.

Ideal for:

* Ram 4500/5500
* Ford F-450/F-550
* Medium-duty platforms
* Off-road builds

### **Flatbed Integration**

If you have a flatbed, we can:

* Add our **low-torsion mount system**
* Or fabricate a **custom low-torsion flatbed** in-house

Both options create a safe, durable platform for the habitat.
