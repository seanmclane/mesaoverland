Rachel and I met Blayne randomly among some friends in April 2022. We were setting up our GoFast Camper and we started talking about it and what we would like to eventually get done to it. Fast forward to the present day, and we just got our truck outfitted with a solar panel that sits under the bars on top of the GoFast and most importantly, a 200amp battery with a full install of a diesel heater. We had quotes to do this same job from larger outfits in the Front Range but they were more expensive and after we shot the quote over to Blayne, he picked their recommendations apart and basically said, their equipment is OK but you want better components, especially the heater. If we went with the larger outfit, we would have had a subpar heater and the build would not have been custom. Blayne and I did a couple of video calls and took some measurements during the calls. This way he began work without the truck being there. So now we are set up for 4 season truck camping and we could not have been happier. Thanks Blayne.
