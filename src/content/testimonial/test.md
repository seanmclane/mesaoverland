⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

My partner and I consulted with Blayne regarding options for a new “home” when our previous rig broke down. He took the time to understand our lifestyle and tailored his recommendations based on what would work best for our needs. We couldn’t be happier with our new setup. We’ve been in our RV for 8 months and are so much happier than in our last rig, it's such a better fit. He hit the nail on the head, making recommendations on the class of RV, features to look for that aligned with our needs, and engine recommendations. So glad we talked to him and followed his advice. I highly recommend him - he’s knowledgeable, takes the time to get to know you and your lifestyle, and his experience in the industry and with life on the road make him a valuable asset.
