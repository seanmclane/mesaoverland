title: About
---


Based in Western Colorado, our campers reflect the landscape we build in — rugged mesas, high desert, mountain passes, and real four-season conditions. We design every habitat to be comfortable in any environment, any season, and for any activity. Our team is made up of master mechanics, designers, fabricators, and outdoor enthusiasts who share one goal: **build the best product we can, every time.**

Mesa Overland started with firsthand experience. Before the shop grew, Blayne — our founder — spent years living full-time on the road in a single rig, using it daily, fixing it when needed, and learning exactly what makes a camper functional, quiet, warm, durable, and worth owning. Those years were where many of the design decisions that define Mesa Overland were formed: what fails, what lasts, what makes a difference, and what’s just sales fluff.

## **Why We Build the Way We Do**

Early on, it became clear that truck-bed habitats are the most capable and adaptable platform for people who want to do a lot with their setup — towing, off-road travel, daily driving, remote camping, you name it. We tested and explored countless construction methods searching for durability, insulation, weight, and value that would hold up in the conditions we build for.

That search led us to **Cascadia Composites**, and we’ve never looked back. Their panels offer the strongest blend of performance, insulation, and longevity we’ve found — without adding unnecessary weight or complexity. We use Cascadia for one simple reason:

**It’s the material we trust to keep you comfortable and protected long-term.**\
It works, and it works everywhere.

## **Why Western Colorado**

Delta and the surrounding Western Slope give us a rare advantage as builders:

* Real heat, real cold, real four-season testing
* A culture of craftsmanship and hard work
* Access to desert, forest, mountains, and high alpine terrain
* A community that still values doing things right
* A pace that lets us focus on quality, not mass production
* Space to fabricate, test, and refine designs without compromise

This region shapes everything about our workflow. Our environment demands reliability — and that’s exactly what we aim to build.

## **Value, Honesty, and Practical Design**

We’re committed to delivering the best value we can. That doesn’t mean “cheap” — it means smart decisions, proven components, and a design approach based on practicality and long-term use. We source products that are reliable, tested, and worth the money. We work with your budget to deliver everything you need and nothing you don’t.

We don’t upsell unnecessary features. We don’t chase trends. We build rigs we’d want to live in and use ourselves.

## **A Personal Touch**

Mesa Overland is built with intention. Some of our model names carry quiet inspiration from Blayne’s daughter — not as marketing, but as a reminder that what we build should represent stability, purpose, and something worth being proud of long-term.

## **Service That Stays Personal**

One thing that has never changed as we’ve grown is how we treat people. When you reach out — whether by text, email, or phone — you’re talking directly with the people building your camper. No layers to fight through, no generic responses, no detached sales team.

We value genuine connection and clear communication. Your experience matters just as much as the finished product.

## **Let’s Build Something That Will Last**

If you’re ready to design a camper that fits your life — whether simple, custom, or somewhere in between — we’re here to help make it happen.

Reach out anytime. We’d love to hear what you’re building toward.
