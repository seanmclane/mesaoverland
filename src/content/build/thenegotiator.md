"The Negotiator" came to us from far eastern Kansas in our search for the best off-road camper base vehicles. We could hardly believe our eyes - a '99 7.3 with 175k miles?! There can't be many of them left. And when the keys had a tag with "The Negotiator" scribbled on it, we had found the perfect name. But with this vehicle, there will be no compromises.

Some of our planned upgrades include:

* 4x4 conversion
* 37" tires
* 4-5" suspension lift
* Turbo upgrade
* New injectors
* Heated fuel system
* Fully rebuilt transmission
* Billet torque converter
* Interior mountain bike storage
* 400W solar and lithium batteries
* and more!
