## New Year, New Build

Ready for sale in late February 2022 comes a marriage of overland articulating mounts and a camper body with all the comforts. We've built a custom, three-point articulating mount to allow the camper to move independently of the frame, reducing stress via frame twisting and improving center of gravity on uneven terrain. Fit to a 2000 F250 with a low-mileage 7.3L engine, this build will be a reliable and affordable entry point to the overland RV lifestyle.
