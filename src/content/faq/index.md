###How are you different from everyone building out 4x4 Sprinters or making overland vehicles?

4x4 Sprinters are great when you want to get to well established campgrounds but show their shortcomings quickly on any real forest roads. You simply can't get enough ground clearance through the maximum tire size or suspension lift to clear moderate drops. Many people see "4x4" and assume it means "offroad capable", but there's a lot more to it.

Overland vehicles are capable on very difficult roads. However, most are not built with interior camping in mind. Rooftop tents and outdoor cooking areas can be great for dry, spring and fall camping. It's a lot more fun to be inside when it's raining or snowing though.

At Mesa Overland, we build custom campers that have the accessibility of overland vehicles with the comfort of vans. We combine a full 4x4 auto shop with RV buildout skills. For those who think their Sprinter could be more capable or their overland truck could be nicer to stay in, we have you covered.

###Can you make my truck into an overland RV?

Yes, if you have a Ford F350+ or Ram 3500+, we can upfit your truck with one of our custom camper models. We can chassis mount with our three-point articulating mount system or mount directly to a flatbed. Our models to fit both 6.5' and 8' beds. And if you've been thinking about a lift or performance modifications, it's the perfect time to upgrade your truck too.

###What is a three-point articulating mount?

A three-point articulating mount has three points of attachment between the camper and the truck frame. These attachment points can move to help reduce the transfer of movement and vibration from offroading to the camper. Imagine a suspension for the camper. We mount all our chassis-mounted campers this way to improve camper longevity and offroading performance.

###How long does it take to get a build done?

As of January 2022, we are taking orders for spring 2022 delivery! Don't wait a year to get what you want.

###Can you help me find a vehicle to build out?

Yes! We are a licensed auto dealer in Colorado and have access to many more vehicles than the general public. If you're having trouble finding a truck or van in this crazy market, let us help.
