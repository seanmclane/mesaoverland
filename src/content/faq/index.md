## **Can you do custom work?**

Absolutely — we live for it.

Every Mesa Overland build allows for personalization, which we group into two categories:

- - -

### **1. Standard Modifications (Phase 2 Starter Package)**

These are handled under our **Phase 2 contract**, which includes:\
**20 hours of design & customization for $2,500**

This covers things like:

* Plyboo stain color selection
* Powdercoat colors for aluminum cabinetry
* Cushion colors & fabrics
* Hardware choices
* Shelf adjustments, partition tweaks, and other small interior refinements
* Minor layout modifications within the standard model structure

This is perfect for customers who want a personalized build without reinventing the wheel.

- - -

### **2. Full Custom Work (Major Layout Changes, Full Interior Redesign, or Custom Sizing)**

For customers who want completely custom sizing or a totally unique layout, we begin with:

* **$1,500** custom-size Phase 1 engineering fee (if sizing deviates from our standard footprints)
* Any work **beyond Phase 1** becomes hourly and is billed in a lump sum based on complexity

  * Full custom design typically runs **~$7,500** in hours
  * Hourly rates range from **$125–$175/hr** depending on whether it’s CAD, engineering, CNC file prep, fabrication planning, etc.

If you can dream it, we can build it — it just takes more engineering hours.

- - -

## **How does the design & build process work?**

### **Phase 1 – Habitat Engineering & Structure**

This locks in your build spot and includes:

* Composite shell design
* Door integration
* Structural layout
* Optional window & penetration planning
* Sizing (or custom sizing with the $1,500 fee)

This gives us the foundation to build your habitat safely and accurately.

### **Phase 2 – Standard Mods + Your Choice of Full Interior or Partial Build**

After Phase 1, you choose how much or how little you want done.

Phase 2 can include:

* The **20-hour Standard Modification package ($2,500)**
* Cabinetry & interior build-out
* Electrical (Victron or Bluetti RV5 systems)
* Plumbing, heat, fixtures
* Flooring, lighting, storage
* MOLLE panels, steps, mounts, accessories
* Full custom interior layouts (hourly)

Think of Phase 2 as your “choose your own adventure” stage — from minimal additions to full living systems.

- - -

## **Do you install the Bluetti RV5 system?**

Yes — we install Bluetti RV5 systems routinely.

These all-in-one systems are reliable, powerful, and integrate seamlessly into Phase 2 electrical packages.\
They’re a killer option for customers who want big power with less wiring complexity.

- - -

## **How much does a habitat cost?**

General pricing for **shell-only** (with a door, no windows or interior):

* **High $20Ks** → small slide-ins
* **$30Ks–$40Ks** → mid-sized habitats
* **Upper $40Ks to low $50Ks+** → large formats or “monster” builds

This is a baseline — windows, penetrations, interior systems, and custom work build from here.

Your **best estimate** always starts with the pricing on the website or standard model sheets.

- - -

## **Windows & Doors – Which should I choose?**

We offer two excellent options:

### **Outbound Windows & Doors**

Our premium recommendation.\
Top-tier performance, incredible build quality, best thermal efficiency — the gold standard.

### **Tern Overland Windows (Arctic Tern)**

Great for weight-sensitive or budget-conscious builds.\
Light, clean designs, and solid performance.

Both integrate beautifully into our composite shells.

- - -

## **Do you build RV-style or frame-mounted campers?**

Yes to both!

### **Frame-Mounted Systems**

We use a **rail-on-rail low-torsion subframe**, allowing the habitat to float with chassis flex.\
This protects the structure and dramatically improves off-road durability.

### **Flatbed Integration**

If you already have a flatbed:

* We can add a **low-torsion mount system** onto your existing bed, or
* Fabricate a full custom flatbed in-house using the same rail-on-rail principles

We also offer slide-in habitat options for trucks and cab chassis.

- - -

## **Can you help me find a truck?**

Absolutely — choosing the right platform is key.\
We can guide you toward:

* Ram 4500/5500
* Ford F-450/F-550
* 2500/3500 platforms
* Cutaway vans
* Or whatever fits your intended use

- - -

## **Can I visit the shop?**

Yes — by appointment only.\
We’re open **Monday–Friday, 8:30 AM–5 PM**.\
Reach out and we’ll get you scheduled.

- - -

## **Do you install electrical & solar on existing campers?**

For Mesa Overland customers: absolutely — that’s part of Phase 2.

For outside campers/vans: sometimes, depending on schedule and scope.\
Ask us — if we can fit it, we will.
