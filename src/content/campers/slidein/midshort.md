      typical in European camper components. They feature a European made double
      locking system and European made acrylic glazing. The double seals and
      considerable heft of these doors feel like a bank vault closing! These
      doors feature powder coated aluminum exterior surfaces, substantial
      insulation, and ABS interior panels. Rounded corners prevent cracking in
      composite walls. The double glazed window features a retractable roller
      blind. This door includes a European, fine mesh roller screen door.
      Available in right hinge only. Our doors are warranted by Tern Overland
      LLC for one year against defects in workmanship and materials. We have a
      complete in house parts and service department. This is truly a quality

  - name: Arctic Tern Wildland door upgrade
    description: 'Arctic Tern Wildlands doors are an exceptional choice for maximum
      ventilation and security. This door is 42" high by 26" wide for the cut
      hole. The door is unique in that it incorporates a triple deadbolted lock
      system on a high-security screen door. Attachments to the latches wrap
      around the inside of the wall so that you would have to tear out the wall
      to pry out the door. The screen door features a stainless steel powder
      coated #6 woven mesh with .040 wire. #6 was chosen because it is the
      largest mesh that a grizzly cannot get a claw into. The door frame is
      recessed to foil prying claws or tools. This allows you to sleep in safety
      with the outer door open in hot weather. This has traditionally been a big
      problem for small off-road camp trailers. The door also features our fine
      mesh bug screen on the outside. This prevents pets from damaging the bug
      screen. The bug screen is easily replaced using conventional screen tools.
      This door has been 4 years in development, for use in areas like Africa
      and Australia for protection primarily from dangerous animals. It presents
      a serious deterrent to 2 legged animals as well. We added our refinements
      and brought it to North America. The door frame is all powdercoated
      aluminum with heavy duty stainless steel latches. The single handle
      actuates all three latch points. The door lock shares the same European
      lock set as our cargo doors and other accessories, so everything can be
      keyed to match for a small fee. The overall quality of this door is
      without peer.'
